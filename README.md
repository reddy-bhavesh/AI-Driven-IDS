# AI-Driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Introduction

The **AI-Driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a cutting-edge project designed to enhance network security by detecting suspicious activities in real-time. Using artificial intelligence, the IDS monitors network traffic and identifies potential intrusions or malicious activities, offering a proactive defense mechanism. This project is crucial in mitigating cybersecurity threats by detecting, visualizing, and alerting users to anomalous patterns in network data.

## Features

- **Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic to detect potential threats.
- **AI-based Detection of Intrusion Activities**: Utilizes machine learning models to identify abnormal patterns and potential intrusions.
- **Traffic Visualization and Alerts**: Provides clear, intuitive visualizations of network traffic and generates alerts for suspicious activities.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Driven-IDS.git
cd AI-Driven-IDS
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Running the system: Start the IDS for real-time network monitoring.
```bash
python src/monitor.py
```

2. Training the model: Train the AI model with new data.
```bash
python src/detection.py --train --dataset datasets/network_data.csv
```
